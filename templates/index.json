He distilled his family’s original Tennessee whiskey to barter with the Mexicans, soldiers, and Indians that inhabited this remote area. Few people would have made the choice to live here, but Benjamin Franklin Roberts thrived in the borderlands. <\/p>"

Like BFR, we stubbornly believe whiskey should be as pure and straightforward as possible, so all of our whiskeys begin with the same mash bill that he distilled back in the 1880s. Then, we desert-age our spirits in custom-made, charred white oak barrels deep in the Chihuahuan Desert. The extreme daily temperature fluctuations in this unique environment create a smooth and complex tasting experience with a smooth finish—uniquely crafted by Desert Ghost.<\/p><p>From our flagship, The Bastard Bourbon, to our Texas Straight Bourbon whiskey and our delicious Honey Bourbon, our spirits have impressed even the most discerning guests. And that’s before we roll out the Bastard Black label, which is truly something to savor. If you can’t make it down to West Texas for a whiskey flight, order up a bottle here and join the growing group of believers in Desert Ghost, the spirit of the borderlands.<\/p>"
